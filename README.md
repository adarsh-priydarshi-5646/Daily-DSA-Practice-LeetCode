## 📖 Examples

### 39. Combination Sum

```
Input: candidates = [2,3,6,7], target = 7
Output: [[2,2,3],[7]]
Explanation: 2 and 3 are candidates, and 2 + 2 + 3 = 7. Note that 2 can be used multiple times. 7 is a candidate, and 7 = 7. These are the only two combinations.
```

### 40. Combination Sum II

```
Input: candidates = [10,1,2,7,6,1,5], target = 8
Output: [[1,1,6],[1,2,5],[1,7],[2,6]]
```

### 46. Permutations

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: [[1,2,3],[1,3,2],[2,1,3],[2,3,1],[3,1,2],[3,2,1]]
```
